# Blender Cheat Sheet
*by Miro Leon Bucher*

This is a list of resources I've used to learn and teach Web Design. Helpful suggestions came from our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pxv5fzmShE), which you are invited to join and contribute to this list that way. You can find more helpful Blender tutorials and more on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@miroxleon) if you are interested.

This list is based on a livestream where I tried to learn Blender after switching over from Cinema 4D. Refer to the video to see (some of the) shortcuts in action:

Remember: If I can do this with an MA in Philosophy and Social- and Cultural Anthropology, you can do this too!

- Go to "Edit Mode" to change the geometry of an object
- Go to "Object Mode" to change the position of an object
- A = Select all
- Alt + A = Deselect all
- B = Box selection
- Subdivide/Subdivision Surface
    - Right click subdivide
    - The subdivision options show up in a menu bar in the bottom left corner
- O = proportional editing
- G = move/position
- E = extrude
- S = scale
- R = rotation
- S -> Z -> type 0 -> enter = flatten surface on the Z axis
    - Same for any other axis with X, Z, or Y
- Edge Loop
    - Ctrl + r = edge loop
    - Move to change position
    - Press ctrl while moving to move in increments
    - Scroll to change number of edge loops
    - Press shift while moving to move precisely
    - Enter to confirm
- S -> X = reduce width, i.e. scale on x axis
- Setting View Angles
    - Edit -> Prefences -> Input -> "Emulate Numpad"
    - 1 = Front
    - Ctrl + 1 = Back
    - 3 = Right
    - Ctrl + 3 = Left

- Extrude Individual Faces (e.g. for fingers)
    - Icon next to global -> select "Individual Origins" to affect multiple faces and affect them according to their own position
    - Alt + E -> Extrude Individual Faces
    - E.g. scale all to make fingers
- G -> G = moving with less deformation
- Ctrl + "+" -> Selects more faces
- Ctrl + "-" -> Selects less faces
- Ctrl + I -> Invert selection
- Ctrl + L -> Selects all connected faces
- Joining two Objects
    - Go to "Object Mode"
    - Select on object *in the viewport*, then shift + click on second object
    - Ctrl + J = Join

The other resource lists include [Three.js](https://miroleon.github.io/threejs-resources/), 3D Rendering, and [AI Resources](https://miroleon.github.io/ai-resources/).
